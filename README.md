# Night Owl - Enhancing a Capstone Project
## My version of Pursuit Fellowship's 8.3 capstone project Worth A Shot.


#### I am a Junior Web Developer seeking my first Full Stack Entry Level Position. Night Owl represents a comprehensive rebranding and redesign of its predecessor, 'Worth A Shot.'
#### Originating from a fullstack, team-based bootcamp project showcased at Google HQ, Night Owl is my endeavor to elevate my proficiency as a fullstack web developer. I am very passionate about this project.

### Goals for Night Owl
1. My first objective is to reimagine the original project's aesthetics using Sass. Transitioning from Worth A Shot's initial CSS to SCSS, I've introduced UI/UX enhancements through user-friendly frontend features. **This redesign remains a work-in-progress in the current application version,** with forthcoming plans to ensure responsiveness across diverse devices and platforms. (The site is currently not optimal for smaller screens).

2. Expanding the site's social functionality is my next goal. I'd like to do this by enabling user connections via chat, friend requests, and public forums. I seek to advance my backend competencies and reinforce my grasp of SQL through these features.

3. The final phase of the app will address security and safety. There is currently a lack of password protection as well as user safety guidelines that would be very beneficial to those planning social events through my app. As a web developer, I am committed to realizing a robust and secure digital environment for my users.

### Deployment Links
* Frontend - https://night-owl-project.netlify.app/
* Backend - (Coming Soon)

### Notes
* Night Owl's backend is not yet deployed, so the login / account creation feature is currently inaccessible
* Night Owl does not currently possess password protection. This feature needs to be redesigned
