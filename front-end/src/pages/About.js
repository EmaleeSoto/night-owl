            I'm a full-stack Junior Web Developer at the Pursuit Fellowship. I
            have studied Computer Science at Hunter College, and plan to finish
            my Bachelor's within the next two years. I love coding, gaming, and
            music!
          </p>
          <p>
            I was inspired to create Night Owl because, as a young adult, I find
            that navigating the night life scene can be sometimes intimidating.
            I wanted to use my engineering abilities to create an app that would
            make socializing and exploring easier for night owls such as myself.

Could not follow it in its flight.
