              I'm a full-stack Junior Web Developer who has completed the
              year-long Pursuit Fellowship bootcamp in New York City. I have
              studied Computer Science at Hunter College, and plan to finish my
              Bachelor's Degree once I acquire my first engineering position. I
              love coding, gaming, and music!
            </p>
            <p className="aboutSection__bio">
              I was inspired to create Night Owl because, as a young adult, I
              find that navigating the night life scene can be sometimes
              intimidating. I wanted to use my engineering abilities to create
              an app that would make socializing and exploring easier for night
              owls such as myself.

Could not follow it in its flight.
